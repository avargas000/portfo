       <p>Hello, my name is Ana Vargas. I am 24 year old student. I am currently an undergrad full-time Biology student who is also a Software Development student at Year up in hopes to become a Bioengineer one day. I am focusing on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on rails, Java, and Python.
       I am a team player, I typically like to spend my weekends playing softball and polishing off my codes. Some of my hobbies include traveling and experiencing different cultures collaborating with others and resolving conflicts on github. A great example of this would be the time I volunteered as a medical volunteer in Nepal for over a month. During this time, I got to know my patients as well as to collab with the local staff.  </p>
